**Introduction**
Bone Fracture Detection Using CNN is a machine learning project designed to analyze medical images and identify bone fractures. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and detection. This project aims to assist medical professionals by providing real-time analysis of X-ray or other medical images.
**Features**
Automated detection of bone fractures in medical images.
User-friendly interface for uploading images.
Real-time predictions with high accuracy.
Visual representation of model performance metrics.
**Usage**
1.Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook bone-fracture-detection-using-cnn.ipynb
2.Alternatively, deploy the Streamlit app for a user-friendly interface:
streamlit run app.py
3.Upload a medical image, and the model will provide a diagnosis.
