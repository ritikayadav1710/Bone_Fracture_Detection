# Bone Fracture Detection Using CNN

**Introduction**

Bone Fracture Detection Using CNN is a machine learning project designed to analyze medical images and identify bone fractures.  
It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and detection.  
This project aims to assist medical professionals by providing real-time analysis of X-ray or other medical images.

**Features**

- Automated detection of bone fractures in medical images.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images.
- Real-time predictions with high accuracy.
- Visual representation of model performance metrics.

**Technologies Used**

- **Python**: For implementing the machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For developing and training the CNN model.

**Usage**

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:  
   For training the model or detailed exploration:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bone-fracture-detection-using-cnn.ipynb
